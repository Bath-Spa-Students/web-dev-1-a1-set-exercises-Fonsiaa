                    The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical coming-of-age drama 
                    film directed by <strong>Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff</strong>, produced by Don Hahn. 
                    The film has an ensemble voice cast and is based on William Shakespeare's 
                    Hamlet, plus elements from the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses. 
                    The plot follows a young heir apparent who is forced to leave when his 
                    uncle murders his father and seizes the kingdom. The film was initially, 
                    non-musical and more factual0 in style. The plot is based on African 
                    animals and follows a young heir apparent who returns to confront the 
                    usurper's oppressive authority. The Lion King was released on June 15, 
                    1994, and received critical acclaim for its music, story, themes, and 
                    animation. It is the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all 
                    time and the best-selling film on home video, selling over 55 million 
                    copies world wide.</p>
