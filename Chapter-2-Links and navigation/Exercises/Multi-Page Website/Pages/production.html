                "The Lion king" making was intended to show how lions maintain
                the animal population by eating them, although in a mythological way. 
                The other tale was during the discussion of making the film
                the topic of the story was set in Africa. That is how <i>Jeffrey Katzenberg</i> 
                had the sudden idea. Where the perspective is the life of the animals
                such as their hardships, responsibilities and experience.

                Through the hard and trials the artist did not have much
                faith when creating the "The Lion King", with the Chapman
                accepting the project even though the chance of popularity
                for the movie is low. The animators had to learn how to draw
                4-legged animals in this matter since the characters were not
                anthropomorphized or human-being body with animal head. Since
                the creation of the movie was made digitally it was easier for
                the animators to draw the characters.</p>
