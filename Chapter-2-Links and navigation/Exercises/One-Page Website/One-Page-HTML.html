                    The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical coming-of-age drama 
                    film directed by <strong>Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff</strong>, produced by Don Hahn. 
                    The film has an ensemble voice cast and is based on William Shakespeare's 
                    Hamlet, plus elements from the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses. 
                    The plot follows a young heir apparent who is forced to leave when his 
                    uncle murders his father and seizes the kingdom. The film was initially, 
                    non-musical and more factual0 in style. The plot is based on African 
                    animals and follows a young heir apparent who returns to confront the 
                    usurper's oppressive authority. The Lion King was released on June 15, 
                    1994, and received critical acclaim for its music, story, themes, and 
                    animation. It is the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all 
                    time and the best-selling film on home video, selling over 55 million 
                    copies world wide.

                    The sun was raising and all the animals started gathering
                    at the kingdom's Pride Land of Africa. There, was a cub
                    named Simba, the son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabai.
                    Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and
                    advisor, carefully lifted Simba to be praised. But
                    the brother of King Mufasa, Scar had a different plan. 
                    <br> <br>As Simba's youthful days has come, King Mufasa showed
                    the Pride Land and told him that everything he saw is
                    part of the circle of life. With Simba's amazement he
                    want to see the elephant graveyard where his uncle Scar
                    lived, with Nala, his best friend. Simba's thinks with his 
                    father as the king of the pride land, nothing will happen to
                    them. Nala was terrified with Simba's action to go there
                    but still when with him. With so little to no
                    knowledge, they were spotted by the hyenas named Shenzi,
                    Banzai, and Ed. <br> <br> But at the end, the hyenas who once
                    obeyed Scar has turned against him. With Scar and the hyenas
                    gone, Simba is able to take his spot as the rightous King of
                    the Pride Land, along side of the him is his best friend, Nala.
                    With the Pride Land back to the good old days, the circle of
                    life continues to live. <br> <br>

                "The Lion king" making was intended to show how lions maintain
                the animal population by eating them, although in a mythological way. 
                The other tale was during the discussion of making the film
                the topic of the story was set in Africa. That is how <i>Jeffrey Katzenberg</i> 
                had the sudden idea. Where the perspective is the life of the animals
                such as their hardships, responsibilities and experience.

                Through the hard and trials the artist did not have much
                faith when creating the "The Lion King", with the Chapman
                accepting the project even though the chance of popularity
                for the movie is low. The animators had to learn how to draw
                4-legged animals in this matter since the characters were not
                anthropomorphized or human-being body with animal head. Since
                the creation of the movie was made digitally it was easier for
                the animators to draw the characters.</p>
